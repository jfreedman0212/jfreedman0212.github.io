<p>Earlier this month, I read Mark Erikson&rsquo;s <a href=https://blog.isquaredsoftware.com/2020/09/coding-career-advice-daily-work-journal/>blog post</a>
on keeping a work journal and decided to take a stab at it. While I didn&rsquo;t implement it exactly as Mark laid out, I enjoy the process
and the benefits it gives me (spoiler alert: it&rsquo;s more than what Mark says).</p>
<h1 id=my-implementation>My Implementation</h1>
<p>At the start of the day, I will create a folder for that day and create a &ldquo;Daily Journal&rdquo; page.
That page acts as the main place for my thoughts and goals that day. I will add secondary pages for things
like meeting notes and scratch paper, but those are not the main focus. Then, I create the first section: <strong>Goals</strong>.</p>
<p>The Goals section will contain the tasks that I want to accomplish that day and look something like:</p>
<ul>
<li><input disabled type=checkbox> Complete UI Workflow for <code>$FEATURE_1</code> (<code>$TICKET_NUMBER</code>)</li>
<li><input disabled type=checkbox> Write tests for <code>$FEATURE_1</code> UI</li>
<li><input disabled type=checkbox> Reach out to UI Team for UI Review</li>
<li><input disabled type=checkbox> Review PR from <code>$DEV</code> about <code>$FEATURE_2</code></li>
</ul>
<p>Doing this at the beginning of the day helps me stay focused and informs how I structure my work that day.
Throughout the day, I&rsquo;ll check things off as I completed them, add a dash to the checkbox to indicate I
worked on it without completing it, or leave it blank if I didn&rsquo;t get to it.</p>
<p>Throughout the day (or at the end if the day was really busy), I&rsquo;ll add the second section: <strong>Log</strong>.
This is the main &ldquo;journal&rdquo; part where I log what has happened each day. This will contain things like:</p>
<ul>
<li>Who I spoke to about what issue</li>
<li>Tasks that I worked on</li>
<li>Interesting problems that I solved (with code examples if applicable)</li>
</ul>
<p>Each thing that I did gets entered as a bullet point with optional, supplementary information as sub-bullets.
This helps me solidify topics that I discussed that day or problems I solved for later lookup and reflection.
I may revisit them and make a blog post out of it (which I did for the Styled Components post) or simply
tell a team member about so they can know too.</p>
<p>Finally, at the end of the day, I&rsquo;ll create the last section: <strong>Reflections</strong>. This is a more free-form section
(although I typically use bullet points) where I talk about how I felt about the events of the day. If I wasn&rsquo;t
able to get a task done on time, or I wasn&rsquo;t happy with my implementation of something, I&rsquo;ll write about how that made me feel.
Additionally, if external factors came into play that day and impacted my demeanor, then I&rsquo;ll document that as well. This lets
me not only log the work I did on a given day, but how I felt about it. It also lets me get any negative feelings out of my system,
which helps me separate from work and enjoy my evening/weekend.</p>
